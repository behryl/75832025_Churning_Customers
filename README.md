Customer Churn Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting customer churn.
The model is built using Python and leverages popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, and Keras. 
The primary goal of this model is to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on various features.

Functionalities
Predicts whether a new customer is likely to churn
Built using Random Forest and Keras. Distribution plots and boxplots are generated to visualize the distribution of selected features, 
differentiating between churn and non-churn customers.
Trained on a dataset of customer churn data. The model undergoes hyperparameter tuning using the Keras Tuner to improve its performance.
Deployed using Streamlit 


To use the model, you will need to first download the model and the scaler and label encoder files.
